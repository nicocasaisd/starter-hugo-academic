I’m Nicolás from Argentina. I have a background in acoustics, digital signal processing and audio. In the last couple of years I became interested in deep learning audio applications and would like to combine my previous knowledge with new and exciting developments.
I have experience as an intern in research projects related to acoustics, acoustic metamaterials, signal processing and toolbox adaptation for educational purposes.
I have a bachelor degree in Audiovisual Technologies at UNLA university and I'm currently studying at UTN university to get a diploma in computer programming.
